# User Stories — Primary User Profile

## Persona: Power User (Rui)

- **Devices:** iPhone (away/quick), iPad (primary daily driver), Desktop (deep work)
- **Sessions:** 5-6 active across multiple instances, topic-based, long-lived
- **Switching:** Typeahead on keyboard, swipe on touch
- **Compose style:** Short concise instructions, occasional long paste (bug reports, feature specs)
- **Queue usage:** Very heavy — queues follow-ups constantly, pulls back for editing frequently
- **Abort:** Rare, expects partial summary
- **Slash commands:** Rare; `/tint` and `/theme` are the most frequent
- **Editor:** Critical on writing-focused instance; zen mode, markdown preview, popouts all used
- **Workspace:** Uploads occasional but critical; rename/delete important but clunky
- **Settings:** Opened very often during dev/test; accessed via typeahead primarily
- **Attachments:** Screenshots pasted constantly, lightbox and file preview heavily used
- **Panes:** Terminal, VNC, office viewers all used on all devices
- **Adaptive Cards:** Liked for logins/pickers; widgets for complex input
- **Push notifications:** Not a priority (HTTPS-limited)
- **Recovery action:** Refresh (full page reload)

- Queue state survives SSE reconnect
- No race conditions between queue state and agent completion

- Number fields accept typed values (not just stepper clicks)
- Changes persist without explicit save button
- Rapid open/close does not duplicate dialogs

- HTML head contains `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` tags with correct sizes
- When avatar changes, manifest icon URLs get a new version parameter
- Icons use the custom agent avatar when configured, not generic defaults
- Android Chrome sees an active service worker with a same-origin GET fetch handler

### US-12: Thoughts Panel Scroll Behaviour
> As a user monitoring agent reasoning, I want the thoughts panel to become scrollable when I click "N more lines" and revert to non-scrollable when I collapse it, so that I can read long reasoning without the panel taking over the screen.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Collapsed: `overflow-y: hidden`, `max-height` clamped to N lines, "X more lines" button visible
- Expanded (thought panel): `overflow-y: auto`, `max-height: min(52vh, 34rem)`, scrollbar appears if content exceeds
- `data-expanded` attribute toggles between "true" and "false"

- Content is preserved across expand/collapse round-trips
- Scroll position resets to top on re-expand

### US-13: Terminal Standalone

- Minimum 44×44px tap target on exit indicator for touch devices

### US-16: Message Deletion from Timeline
> As a user managing conversation history, I want to delete messages and their cascading thread replies correctly, so that cleanup doesn't leave orphaned replies or lose data unexpectedly.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Delete button visible on message hover
- Single message (no replies): deletes immediately, no confirmation
- Parent with replies: shows confirmation dialog mentioning reply count

- Suppressed compaction shows backoff notice with failure count / retry timing

### US-19: Model Switching After Compaction
> As a user, I want to switch to a smaller context model immediately after compaction, so that I can continue working with a model appropriate for my reduced context.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Model button in compose bar is clickable during and after compaction
- Clicking model button opens model selector/settings
- `/model` command shows current model or available list
- Model switch shows "Switching…" transition label

- Close button still works as explicit fallback
- Lightbox stays closed after dismissal (no flicker/re-render)

### US-21: Session Swipe Independence
> As a mobile user, I want to swipe between sessions regardless of which UI elements are visible, so that session navigation works consistently no matter what pane is open.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Swipe works on the timeline regardless of which panes are open (workspace, editor, dock)
- Workspace explorer being visible does NOT prevent swipe on the timeline
- Editor pane being visible does NOT prevent swipe on the timeline
- Terminal dock being visible does NOT prevent swipe on the timeline
- Swipe IS blocked inside actual interactive controls (compose box, text inputs, contenteditable)
- Swipe IS blocked inside the editor content area (which handles its own horizontal gestures)
- Swipe passes through agent thinking/status panels
- Apple Pencil does not trigger swipe
- Visual indicator shows adjacent session name during gesture

### US-22: Settings Dialog Layering
> As a user opening settings while the workspace pane is visible, I want the settings backdrop to be partially opaque and above all other elements, so that only the settings dialog is interactive and the rest is dimmed.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Semi-transparent backdrop covers entire viewport when settings opens
- Backdrop is above workspace pane (z-index: 2400 > workspace z-index)
- Backdrop opacity is between 0.3 and 0.8 (dimmed but visible behind)
- Workspace pane is not clickable through the backdrop
- Settings dialog is fully visible (not clipped by workspace or any other pane)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Hovering over the context pie shows "Context: XK / YK tokens (Z%)"
- Both used and total token counts are present
- Percentage matches the visual fill of the pie arc
- Tooltip includes "Compact context" action hint when not compacting

- aria-label matches title for screen reader accessibility
- Token values update after agent turns (usage increases)
- Title attribute is always present (native tooltip on hover)

### US-23: Mobile PWA Viewport and Themed Safe Areas
> As an iPhone/iPad home-screen webapp user, I want the compose area to remain flush with the bottom edge and the active theme to cover every safe-area/background surface, so that the app feels native and never shows a blank strip below compose.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- In standalone mobile mode, `--app-height` uses the layout viewport when `visualViewport.height` is only slightly shorter due to iOS chrome/safe-area reporting
- Small closed-keyboard viewport gaps (for example ~59px) do not shorten the app shell or create whitespace below compose
- Large viewport shrink values are still respected for the virtual keyboard
- The compose box bottom edge is within a few pixels of the visible app surface bottom
- The point below compose is either outside the viewport or belongs to compose/app chrome, never a blank body strip
- Persisted themes apply before/at app boot in standalone mode
- Theme changes update CSS variables, root/body inline backgrounds, and PWA `theme-color` meta tags
- Non-default themes and default+tint both cover root/body safe-area backgrounds
